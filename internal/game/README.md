  - `scene_story.go`: Scenes dedicated to cinematic storytelling.
  - `scene_summary.go`: Scene for displaying results and scores.
  - `sounds.go`: Management of game-specific audio triggers.
  - `phases/`: Phase-specific logic and entity layouts for gameplay levels.
  - `types/`: Custom types for game scenes and state management.

## Customization and Implementation

- `render/`: Contains game-specific rendering logic.
  - `vfx/`: Game-specific visual effects, such as overhead and screen text.
